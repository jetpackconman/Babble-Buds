                        <li>You can move your puppet around the stage using the left and right arrow keys</li>
                        <li>You can change emotes by either pressing the emote buttons under the stage or their associated hotkey</li>
                        <li>You can change puppets by either pressing the puppet buttons under the stage or their associated hotkey</li>
                        <li>Holding shift will only change your body, holding ctrl will only change your head</li>
                        <li>You can "babble" by holding down space</li>
                        <li>Right clicking on a puppet button allows you to replace what puppet is stored in that hotbar slot</li>

                        <li>Save will save your current puppet. Changes will not appear in the stage until you save the puppet. Note this does NOT save the <em>project</em>, so closing the program will not preserve your changes</li>
                        <li>New will allow you to create a new puppet from scratch (does not get added to your puppet list until saved)</li>
                        <li>Duplicate creates a copy of your current puppet (does not get added to your puppet list until saved)</li>
                        <li>Import allows you to select a puppet file from another project, and add it to your current project</li>
                        <li>You can also click a puppet on the stage (even other players' puppets!) to open a copy of the puppet in the editor (does not get added to your puppet list until saved)</li>
                        <li>The layers tab allows you to select which layer of the puppet you are editing</li>
                        <li>The babble tab allows you to select which emotes the puppet can cycle through whilst babbling</li>
                        <li>The settings tab is where you can rename the puppet, delete the puppet, and adjust its settings
                        <ul>
                            <li>The "Bobble head while talking" option decides whether or not the head, emotes, and hat layers bobble up and down while talking</li>

                        </li>

                        <li>Only one emote layer will be visible at a time</li>
                        <li>Each emote actually has two sub-layers: the mouth and the eyes. You can toggle between the two in the layers tab</li>
                        <li>Asset Bundles are actually collections of assets which can be on various layers, and are edited in their own special layer</li>

                <div id="assets-content">
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can add assets to a puppet by dragging (or clicking to pick up) an asset from the asset finder below the editor, and placing it in the editor</li>
                        <li>Holding down shift while placing an asset allows you to add multiple copies of that asset</li>
                        <li>There are different asset lists to help organize assets, as well as a search bar</li>
                        <li>Right clicking an asset allows you to rename it, delete it, or move it to a different list</li>
                        <li>You can create and rename asset lists, and import lists from other projects</li>
                        <li>You can create asset bundles, which you edit like puppets, but can place onto puppets like an asset
                        <ul>
                            <li>They are useful for doing things like creating a standardized head or face or body, and then being able to place it on several different puppets</li>
                            <li>Editing an asset bundle will update any puppet that uses it</li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Clicking an asset in the editor will allow you to select it</li>
                        <li>Selected assets can be moved, scaled, and rotated
                        <ul>
                            <li>While scaling, holding shift scaled from the center instead of the corner, and holding control maintains the aspect ratio</li>
                            <li>While moving, holding control will make it only move on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or at any 45° angle</li>
                            <li>While rotating, holding control will make it rotate in 45° increments</li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>You can cut, copy, paste, and delete selected assets using <code>control x</code>(<code>command</code> on mac), <code>control c</code>, <code>control v</code>, and <code>delete</code>, respectively</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Turning on the green screen replaces the background of the stage with a solid color, configurable in the project settings. This is to help replace the background with other content through video editing</li>
                        <li>Project settings allows you to configure things that affect the project
                        <ul>
                            <li>Green screen color is the solid color that replaces the background when green screen is enabled. It's also the background color of the popout</li>
                            <li>Transparent popout means making the popout have a transparent background. It already doesn't have windows decorations, so this would make it so just the puppets are visible, the rest of the window would be completely transparent</li>
                            <li>Minimum slot width is a number (in pixels) where the stage will scale down if there isn't enough room for the current number of slots at the current minimum slot width</li>
                            <li>Number of slots is a number that represents how many slots there are for puppets to move between on the stage. This is the only setting that gets synced over the network</li>
                            <li>Server IP and Port are for networking</li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The popout is a second window with just the stage on it. It'll still accept hotkey inputs like the main window, and can be used when you don't need to see the rest of the program</li>
                        <li>Hosting server will allow other users to connect to you. This may require port forwarding or other complex things. Works with localhost and LAN IP addresses, generally without needing any additional configuration</li>
                        <li>Connecting to a server allows you to join someone else's session. It uses the IP address listed in the project settings</li>
                    </ul>

                <div id="debugging-content">
                    <p>If something goes wrong, you can click the status bar (the thing between the stage and the area with all the puppet and emote buttons) to open the console. Any errors should appear there, along with debug messages. When submitting a bug report you can post any relevant log entries there.</p>
